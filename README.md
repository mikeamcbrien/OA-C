# OA-C (Connectors)
OhioAnts connectors provide a secure way to connect different ant habitats or outworlds. They are specifically designed for connecting 3/8 ID vinyl tubing available at most local home improvement stores; optionally, you can purchase compatible Vinyl tubing through Amazon - https://amzn.to/3yVcgrc 

## Details
The design files include three types of connectors; 
1. "L Shaped" great for tight corners to prevent kinking of the vinyl tubing.
2. "T Shaped" for connecting multiple habitats, also very useful for connecting a test-tube filled with water (and black by cotton), providing long-term water/humidity for your ant's as a backup or emergency water source.
3. "X Shaped" for connecting larger, more complex habitats and setups.

## Printing
Print at .2mm height and 25-30% infill. 

PLA, ABS and PETG are great for this print. PETG and ABS are prefered as they tend to be less brittle. Light gray PETG available here (https://amzn.to/3dBMde2)

## Other Items to Use This Connector.

### Don't Have a 3D printer?
While the intent is to allow users and local communities to download and print, or if it is not cost-effective, to order additional supplies for one-off prints. You can purchase this item online at https://www.ohioants.com/shop/
